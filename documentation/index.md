# Documentation

<p align="justify">
We provide for Anima a set of different documentations, with the aim of helping either the end user for installation and use, as well as for the developer who would like to modify Anima. These different documentations are listed here:
</p>

<ul>
	<li><a href="http://anima.rtfd.io/">End user guide</a>: a user driven documentation of the various tools and scripts available</li>
	<li><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/doxygen/classes.html">Doxygen documentation</a>: developer driven documentation of all classes included in Anima current release</li>
</ul>

# Community help

For more details or questions, we have set up two mailing lists:

* a users list at <a href="mailto:anima-users[AT]inria.fr">anima-users@inria.fr</a>: for any user or developer related questions
* a licensing list at <a href="mailto:anima-licensing[AT]inria.fr">anima-licensing@inria.fr</a>: we know our choice of license can be complicated for companies. But if you are in the case the license is not appropriate to you, please send us an email, we are interested in feedback and discussing a specific license for some user categories.

And we of course have the issues pages on our [Github repository](https://github.com/Inria-Visages/Anima-Public/issues) for any code-related issue (bug, crash, etc.) or feature request.
